This is a simple bash script that allows connecting to nordvpn via Linux CLI.

It will prompt for the "success URL" after logging in from the URL link given after attempting to login via the CLI, which can be used to grant access to the client.

This was tested on Debian Linux (via `apt install nordvpn`).
